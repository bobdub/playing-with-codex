To get the Aurora image into version control and produce the actual artifact with the blueprint, run the following sequence:

Track the blueprint in git so the repository captures the configuration that defines the image:

git add blueprints/imagination-network-os.toml
git commit -m "Seed Aurora baseline"

Push, resolve, and start the compose using composer-cli:

composer-cli blueprints push blueprints/imagination-network-os.toml
composer-cli blueprints depsolve imagination-network-os
composer-cli compose start imagination-network-os qcow2

After the compose finishes, capture the build artifacts (logs, metadata, and the image itself):

compose_id=$(composer-cli compose status --json | jq -r '.[0].id')
composer-cli compose logs "$compose_id"
composer-cli compose metadata "$compose_id"
composer-cli compose image "$compose_id"

(Optionally) kick off additional targets such as an OSTree edge container or AMI if you need them for downstream distribution:

composer-cli compose start-ostree --ref rhel/9/x86_64/edge imagination-network-os edge-container
composer-cli compose start imagination-network-os ami
