# Landing Page Projection: Between Vision and Everyday Friction

## What the Portal Promises Right Now
The interface still presents itself as a phase-one showcase: a Qwen-powered hero prompt anchors the page, complete with live status copy, prompt transmission controls, and surface-level metrics for pulses and dream nodes.【F:public/index.html†L23-L71】 Supporting sections describe the ability to capture prompts, explore a knowledge index, and dabble with a neural terminal, reiterating that the experience is framed as an accessible, information-rich portal rather than a full operating system.【F:public/index.html†L76-L159】【F:docs/ProjectPlan.md†L5-L19】 The refreshed project plan acknowledges this positioning, outlining an incremental roadmap that keeps the brochure-style presentation while charting a path toward richer services.【F:docs/ProjectPlan.md†L32-L77】

## Mundane Friction We Still Haven’t Resolved
Beneath the luminous copy, the ordinary ergonomics continue to creak. The landing portal form disables built-in browser validation via `novalidate` and leans on a single JavaScript check that only confirms the prompt field is non-empty before storing data.【F:public/index.html†L102-L123】【F:public/app.js†L1048-L1069】 Prompts land in `localStorage` without schema versioning, quota recovery, or any export/delete affordances, and failures only trigger console warnings.【F:public/app.js†L582-L603】 Even the on-page log hides history by slicing to the last six entries, so contributors cannot review earlier pulses without spelunking into storage manually.【F:public/app.js†L852-L879】

The knowledge explorer leans on a static JSON artifact fetched from the docs folder; it must be regenerated manually, and the UI has no awareness of staleness beyond a generic error message when the fetch fails.【F:public/app.js†L1023-L1045】【F:docs/ProjectPlan.md†L5-L8】 Likewise, the neural terminal still runs as a self-contained simulation with scripted commands, underscoring that we have not built the backend needed to honor the experiential promise.【F:docs/ProjectPlan.md†L15-L19】 Finally, the headline Qwen integration continues to depend on caretakers correctly wiring a reverse proxy and compatible chat endpoint; when that gateway is missing, the hero gracefully reports an offline state, but there is no automation to make the setup less brittle.【F:docs/ProjectPlan.md†L9-L30】【F:public/app.js†L683-L833】

## Where the Path Needs to Tighten
The immediate projection should center on reinforcing these mundane seams: restore resilient validation, give contributors control over their stored pulses, surface knowledge-index freshness, and reduce the manual choreography required for the Qwen gateway. Those repairs are the practical floor needed before the roadmap’s next phases—API-backed storage, agent orchestration, and ethics layers—can feel believable.【F:docs/ProjectPlan.md†L32-L77】 Until we resolve them, the landing page remains a beautifully described doorway with a sticky hinge.
