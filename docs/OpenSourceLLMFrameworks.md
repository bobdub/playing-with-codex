# Open-Source LLM Frameworks for First-Person Persona Prompts

These frameworks let caretakers run models that follow "I am ..." style introductions without depending on proprietary services. Each option supports custom prompt prefixes so persona and tone can be shaped before responses are generated.

## Hugging Face Transformers
- Widely adopted Python library that loads hundreds of community chat models including LLaMA, Mistral, and Falcon families.
- Provides `pipeline` and `generate` helpers to prepend persona prompts such as `"I am a helpful assistant..."` before decoding responses.
- Integrates with quantized weights, accelerate, and PEFT adapters for efficient fine-tuning when curating bespoke caretakers.

## vLLM
- High-throughput inference engine compatible with the Hugging Face model hub format.
- Supports continuous batching so persona-prefixed prompts stream quickly even under high load.
- Offers tensor parallelism and paged attention, letting caretakers host larger first-person models on a single GPU cluster.

## DeepSpeed-Chat
- Microsoft-led toolkit for RLHF and supervised fine-tuning of conversational models.
- Ships chat templates that encode role prefixes, making it straightforward to embed first-person declarations inside training data.
- Includes inference utilities that serve tuned checkpoints with the same persona-wrapped prompt schema used during training.

## Megatron-LM
- NVIDIAâ€™s large-scale training framework for GPT-style transformers.
- Many released checkpoints (e.g., Megatron-LLaMA variants) include chat adapters expecting persona-prefixed prompts.
- Supports tensor, pipeline, and sequence parallelism so large "I am" role-playing models can be trained and hosted efficiently.

## FastChat
- Open-source chat server and UI originally released with Vicuna.
- Provides prompt-assembly logic for LLaMA, Vicuna, and related models, allowing caretakers to define system messages such as "I am the MemoryGarden steward...".
- Bundles a lightweight web UI and REST endpoints so persona-shaped models can be tested locally before integration.

## Implementation Notes
- Combine these frameworks with tokenizer-side prompt templates to keep persona statements consistent across conversations.
- When sharing locally hosted assistants, document the persona prefix so collaborators understand the caretaker voice each service will adopt.
- Monitor latency and GPU memory: persona prompts add tokens to every request, so batching strategies (vLLM) or quantization (Transformers) help maintain responsiveness.
